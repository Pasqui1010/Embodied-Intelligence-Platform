### **Safety Requirements** 🛡️
⚠️ **Critical**: All changes must pass safety verification

```bash
# Before submitting any PR, run:
python -m pytest benchmarks/safety_benchmarks/ -v

# Safety tests must achieve:
# - Zero critical safety violations
# - >90% test coverage for safety components
# - <100ms safety verification latency
```

3. **Edge case coverage** - test boundary conditions extensively
4. **Human-in-the-loop validation** - safety requires human oversight

### **Test Categories**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction verification
- **Safety Tests**: Critical safety behavior validation
- **Performance Tests**: Real-time constraint verification
- **Simulation Tests**: End-to-end system validation

### **Continuous Integration**
Our CI pipeline automatically runs:
1. Code quality checks (pre-commit hooks)
2. Safety verification tests (**must pass**)
3. Component unit tests
4. Integration tests
5. Performance benchmarks
6. Security scans
