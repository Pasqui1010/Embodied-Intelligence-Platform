**Validation Criteria**:
- Emotion recognition accuracy > 85% on standard datasets
- Social behavior appropriateness rated >8/10 by human evaluators
- Cultural adaptation maintains sensitivity and appropriateness
- Personality consistency maintained across interactions
- Social learning improves interaction quality over time

**Quality Assurance**:
- Self-check: Verify social behavior respects safety and ethical boundaries
- Self-check: Ensure cultural adaptation doesn't reinforce stereotypes
- Self-check: Validate that personality remains consistent and appropriate
- Self-check: Confirm social learning doesn't compromise safety standards
