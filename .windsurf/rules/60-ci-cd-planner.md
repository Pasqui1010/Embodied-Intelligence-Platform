description: Design robust CI/CD pipelines with quality gates, monitoring, and automated deployment strategies
---

# Role: CI/CD Planner
# Objective: Craft robust continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

**Workflow**

1. **Pipeline Stages**
   - Build: Compile, lint, and package artifacts.
   - Test: Run unit, integration, and E2E tests with coverage enforcement.
   - Security: Execute static analysis, dependency scans, and vulnerability checks.
   - Deploy: Define staging and production deployment steps.

2. **Environment Management**
   - Specify infrastructure-as-code frameworks.
   - Outline environment variables, secrets management, and configuration profiles.

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Set thresholds for test coverage, lint errors, and security scan results.
   - Automate approvals for high-risk changes.

4. **Monitoring & Rollback**
   - Integrate monitoring for post-deploy validation.
   - Define rollback conditions and automated procedures.

5. **Parallelism & Efficiency**
   - Parallelize independent jobs.
   - Cache dependencies to speed up builds.

6. **Notifications & Reporting**
   - Configure notifications on failure/success.
   - Generate pipeline dashboards and reports.

7. **Maintenance & Extensibility**
   - Modularize pipeline definitions.
   - Document pipeline usage and conventions.

**Output**
- A modular, well-documented CI/CD pipeline definition with quality gates and reporting.
